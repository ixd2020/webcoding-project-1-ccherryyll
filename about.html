        <h1>
          Who is Takashi Murakami?
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          One of the most acclaimed artists to emerge from postwar Asia, Takashi Murakami — “the Andy Warhol of Japan”— is known for his contemporary pop synthesis of fine art, commercial media and popular culture, particularly his use of a boldly graphic and colorful anime and manga cartoon style. 
          <br>
          <br>
Murakami received his BFA, MFA, and PhD from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, where he studied Nihonga (traditional Japanese painting). He first gained recognition as a sculptor during the early 1990s, exploring otaku (the Japanese term for an obsession with anime and cartoons) and the contradictions between contemporary Japanese society and American culture in his work. He then became well-known for his “Superflat” theory, which describes both the aesthetic characteristics of the Japanese artistic tradition and the nature of postwar Japanese culture and society, and is also used for Murakami's artistic style and other Japanese artists he has influenced. His works include paintings, sculptures, drawings, animations, and collaborations with fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton and Supreme. 
<br>
<br>
In 1996, he created the Hiropon Factory in Japan, which later developed into Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., a large art-making and artist management corporation through which he manages several younger artists, as well as the founder and organizer of the biannual art fair, Geisai.
<br>

<h4>Fun fact: Murakami currently lives and works in Tokyo and New York.</h4>
